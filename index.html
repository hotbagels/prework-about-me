      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi, I'm Shane! I've spent the past 10 years of my life as a 
        Photographer, soon to be turned web developer. 
        I live with my lovely girlfriend Kelsey, our golden retriever puppy named Theo, and the true leader of the house, Veda the cat.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Telford, Pennsylvania</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Some of my favorite things to do include camping, photography, going to concerts, and researching every random thing I can think to learn</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I've always wanted to create and run visual aspects of concerts and music festivals </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Southwest Center City</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I see it as a good path from photographer of an catalog/e-commerence fashion company to something more in-line with a greater goal </p>
